Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration: A User-Friendly Tool Using Streamlit and Plotly

**Technologies used in this project**
1. Github Cloning,
2. Python, Pandas,
3.  MySQL,
4.  mysql-connector-python,
5.  Streamlit, 
6.  Plotly.

**steps:**
1. Extract data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository through scripting and
clone it.
2. Transform the data into a suitable format and perform any necessary cleaning
and pre-processing steps.
3. Insert the transformed data into a MySQL database for efficient storage and
retrieval.
4. Create a live geo-visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly in Python
to display the data in an interactive and visually appealing manner.
5. Fetch the data from the MySQL database to display in the dashboard.


**Approach**

**Data Extraction:** We script to clone the Phonepe Pulse Github repository, securing the data for analysis.
**Data Transformation:** Using Python and libraries like Pandas, we clean and process the data, making it analysis-ready.
**Database Insertion:** We harness the power of the "mysql-connector-python" library to insert cleaned data into a MySQL database for efficient storage.
**Dashboard Creation:** With Python's Streamlit and Plotly libraries, we craft an engaging dashboard. Plotly's geo functions provide insightful geographical visualizations, while Streamlit creates a user-friendly interface with diverse dropdown options.
**Data Retrieval:** Using the "mysql-connector-python" library, we fetch data from the MySQL database, dynamically updating the dashboard.
**Deployment:** We prioritize security, efficiency, and user-friendliness, deploying the dashboard for public access, and ensuring easy navigation and seamless functionality.

**Results:**
          Our project culminates in a dynamic geo-visualization dashboard. With live updates from the Phonepe Pulse Github repository, you'll experience data in a whole new light. Explore various dropdown options that cater to your curiosity, offering over 10 different facts and figures. This interactive dashboard, accessible from your web browser, empowers you to explore insights effortlessly.Gain valuable insights, make informed decisions, and unravel trends within the Phonepe Pulse data.
